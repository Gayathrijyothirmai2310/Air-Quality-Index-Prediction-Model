# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction-Model

The goal of this research is to use machine learning techniques to create an enhanced Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction model.  The algorithm will let people and organisations take proactive steps to lessen the negative consequences of air pollution by precisely predicting AQI values based on real-time data from several contaminants.  Data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model construction, and evaluation are all part of the project.  The ultimate objective is to develop an accurate and dependable AQI prediction tool that can support environmental and public health initiatives.
